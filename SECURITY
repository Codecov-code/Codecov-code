Codecov utilizes GCP (Google Cloud Platform) for our cloud-based products, Terraform for IaC (Infrastructure as Code), and Docker/Kubernetes for microservices. See Google’s SOC3 report here.
Docker images are squashed and/or multistaged to prevent docker layer attacks.
All publicly available assets hosted in GCP, virtual servers in GCP, and employee endpoints are vulnerability scanned on a daily basis. Tickets for vulnerabilities are automatically created and assigned a due date based on our IR (Incident Response) policy SLA ( < 30 days for Critical and High, < 60 days for Medium, < 120 days for Low).
All GCP Kubernetes nodes and employee endpoints run EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) agents configured to quarantine any malware detected and log to our cloud-based SIEM.
Use of SSO and endpoint compliance monitoring tools to ensure 2FA is used whenever possible and endpoints are full disk encrypted, screen-lock enabled, etc.
Codecov Code Security
Codecov utilizes numerous tools to detect vulnerabilities and protect our code, including:
Static application security testing (SAST)
Dynamic application security testing (DAST)
Repository dependency scanning
Scanning repos for secrets (API keys, passwords, etc) to ensure they are not stored or hard coded in our code base.
Usage of GCP’s Secret Manager and environment variables for proper secret protection and inclusion at runtime.
All commits to Codecov repos are GPG signed and require a code review before merging.
All Codecov code repositories are only accessible via employee specific accounts registered to Sentry-owned domains.
All commits to repos that have security relevant changes undergo a code review by our Security Team.
2FA is enabled for access to our code base, with 2FA and VPN required for access to our GCP resources.
All Codecov uploader binaries are SHA256 signed, and changes to uploader binaries are monitored and immediately reported to staff. For instructions on how to verify uploader binaries, see here.
Codecov Vulnerability Testing/Pentesting
Codecov undergoes third party vulnerability/pentesting to support our SOC2 compliance efforts.
Codecov also performs internal network and application security scanning as follows:
Daily network and host-based vulnerability scanning for endpoints, virtual servers in GCP, and publicly accessible assets in GCP
Codecov Security Awareness
Codecov requires yearly security awareness training for all staff.
Secure coding training for development, security, and devops teams is given yearly.
Codecov Responsible Disclosure Policy
Data security is a top priority for Codecov, and Codecov believes that working with skilled security researchers can identify weaknesses in any technology.

Codecov participates in the Sentry.io HackerOne bug bounty program. You may request an invite by sending an email to security@sentry.io and we will ensure that your findings get passed along to the security team for remediation if you’ve found a security vulnerability in Codecov’s service.

Follow this repo to get the latest security advisories about our codebase.

Disclosure Policy
If you believe you’ve discovered a potential vulnerability, please let us know by emailing us at security@codecov.io . We will acknowledge your email within five business days.
Provide us with a reasonable amount of time to resolve the issue before disclosing it to the public or a third party. We aim to resolve critical issues within five business days of disclosure.
Make a good faith effort to avoid violating privacy, destroying data, or interrupting or degrading the Codecov service. Please only interact with accounts you own or for which you have explicit permission from the account holder.
Exclusions
While researching, we’d like you to refrain from:

Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)
Spamming
Social engineering or phishing of Codecov employees or contractors
Any attacks against Codecov’s physical property or data centers
Thank you for helping to keep Codecov and our users safe!
